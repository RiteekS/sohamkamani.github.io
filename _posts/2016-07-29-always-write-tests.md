Until I started my first job, I didn't even know what "writing tests" meant. Why would you want to write more code for your code?  

Even now, I come across all sorts of people who consider writing test cases a chore.

>My deadlines are too short to afford tests

or

>This project is too small to write tests for.

or

>This is just a side project... nothing serious. Why would I want to write tests for it?

Are some of the more common reasons you would find for not testing your code.  

If you observe closely, a common theme in all these reasons is the assumption that testing your code will take more of your time.
