GIFs have been around for as long as I can remember, and today they're as popular as ever. For an image format so popular, GIFs are horribly outdated and inefficient, and they should die. Hopefully by the end of this post I'll have convinced you to fight the plague that is the GIF image format.

Alright, I could go on and on about how we should get rid of GIFs, but lets take a moment to find out why I feel so strongly about this.

### The origin and intent of the GIF

Ironically, even though I am calling GIFs inefficient today, the reason they got so popular back in the day (1987) is *because* they were efficient. GIFs used a form of image compression (called LZW compression) which allowed for even large images to be downloaded in a short time, with slow bandwidth. Later, basic animation was added to the specs, which allowed for multiple images to be painted one after the other with a certain time delay.

Turns out, this compression technique, coupled with animation, and the addition of transparency made GIFs particularly useful for displaying logos and simple animated icons with ~10 frames of images, like the ones you see on the [official Space Jam website](http://www.warnerbros.com/archive/spacejam/movie/cmp/tunes/tunesframes.html).  
**Don't get me wrong, GIFs were pretty amazing at the time for the use case they were designed for.**
