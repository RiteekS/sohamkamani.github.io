In many of the applications we build today, there is often a need to have a unique identifier for any piece of data we use in our application. The universally unique identifier, or UUID, was designed to provide a consistent format for any ID we use for our data. Another problem UUIDs were here to solve, was to not give a potential adversary any information about the data it represented.

As it turns out, making something unique and untraceable is not as straightforward as it seems. I mean, how do you ensure that there is just one copy of the identifier you made, and no more? And even then, how do you make sure that there is no correlation between any two identifiers?

The answer is, you can't do both. This is a tradeoff between uniqueness and randomness that is represented by v1 and v4 of UUID generators.

### So what are they really?

UUIDs are just 128 bit pieces of data, that is displayed as (128/4) = 32 hexadecimal digits, like this :

UUID v1 : <span id="uuidv1"></span>  

UUID v4 : <span id="uuidv4"></span>

<button id="regenerate">Regenerate â†»</button>


<script src="/assets/scripts/uuid.js"></script>
<script>
var v1container = document.getElementById('uuidv1')
var v4container = document.getElementById('uuidv4')

v1container.innerHTML = uuid.v1()
v4container.innerHTML = uuid.v4()

document.getElementById('regenerate').addEventListener('click', function(){
  v1container.innerHTML = uuid.v1()
  v4container.innerHTML = uuid.v4()
})
</script>
