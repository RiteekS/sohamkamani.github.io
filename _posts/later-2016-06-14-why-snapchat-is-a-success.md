The [async actions tutorial](http://redux.js.org/docs/advanced/AsyncActions.html) given in the documentation is no doubt a scalable approach to handling these kind of situations, but it's not very simple, and you would need to go over it a couple of times before you get used to the idea. Sometimes, we need a simpler method for addressing API calls in apps that are not-so-complex.
